GALLY : A 3D RASTERIZER / RAYTRACER
####################################
      Frédéric van der Essen.
------------------------------------

INSTALL : 
=========
	You must first get the dependences. They are 'libpng' and 'libxml2'
	On debian like OS you can install with 
	'apt-get install libpng-dev libxml2-dev' as root.

	To compile simply type 'make all in' the Makefile directory. 

USAGE 	:
=========
	The resulting binary is called renderer.bin. It can be called with 
	those arguments. All arguments must be separated by spaces, and 
	there cannot be space between the equal sign and the argument value.

	Mendatory arguments : 
	"""""""""""""""""""""
		-scene=PATH   : the path to the sdl scene file
	Optional arguments:
	"""""""""""""""""""
		-ray(tracer)  : use the raytracer.  (default method)
		-ras(teriser) : use the rasteriser. (you can't use both 
							at the same time)
		-out=PATH     : path to the png output (default: 'out.png') 
		-sx=INT       : the horizontal rendering size (default:256)
		-sy=INT       : the vertical rendering size   (default:256)
		-h(elp)       : displays this message.\n
	
	
	Sdl file format Modifications : 
	The only supported geometry is the OBJ. The xml syntax is :
	
			 <Obj src="PATH" /> 

	The path has to be specified from the renderer.bin directory

	The Obj must have valid vertex normals for a correct rendering. 


DOCUMENTATION AND ARCHITECTURE :
================================
	The method specification is usually in the .h files, except for static
	functions. Source files are in the src/ directory.

	ga_math.c	<- Matrix and vectors 
	ga_geom.c	<- Triangle, Models, Obj file loading. 
	ga_scene.h	<- scene and scene graph data structure
	ga_scene.c	<- scene and scene graph data structure implementation
	ga_scene_load.c	<- sdl file loading
	ga_img.c	<- image, zbuffer, image save
	ga_raytrace.c	<- raytracer and raytracer shading
	ga_raster.c	<- rasteriser
	ga_list.c	<- linked list
	ga_main.c	<- parsing arguments, main function

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES :
======================
	Currently there is no acceleration data structure for the raytracer, 	
	so it is much slower than the rasterizer.
	
	Object transformations are not taken into account.

	All lights are considered active at all times.
	
	field of view specifies the horizontal view angle in degrees. 

	The raytracer doesn't render backfacing faces, making it about two times
	faster. (early check in intersection test)
